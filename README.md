In this instance of the course, students were to start the development of their own online Salvo game.
* Back End: Java, Spring Boot.
* Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

This project is divided into two modules: this is the first one.

The development of the project's Back End is almost completed (some parts were to be tasked on the next module). However, the Front End was merely developed for testing purposes.
